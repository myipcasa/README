# myIP.casa

myIP.casa is a free, browser-based collection of network diagnostic tools designed to help users understand and troubleshoot internet connectivity issues.

The platform provides simple, fast, and accessible tools that work without installation, registration, or client-side software. All checks run directly from the browser and focus on clarity and reliability.

## What myIP.casa Does

myIP.casa helps answer common networking questions such as:
- What is my public IP address?
- Which ports are open or blocked?
- Is my VPN leaking DNS requests?
- How does my traffic route across the internet?
- What is the latency and quality of my connection?
- Is an SSL/TLS certificate correctly configured?

The tools are designed for both technical and non-technical users who need quick and accurate diagnostics.

## Available Tools

- **Public IP Lookup**  
  Displays the public IP address, IP version (IPv4 or IPv6), ASN, ISP, and approximate geolocation.

- **Port Checker**  
  Tests whether specific TCP ports are open, closed, or filtered from the internet.

- **DNS Leak Test**  
  Detects which DNS resolvers are used and identifies potential DNS leaks, especially when using a VPN.

- **Traceroute**  
  Shows the network path and latency between the user and a destination host.

- **Latency and Speed Tests**  
  Measures round-trip time, connection stability, and basic throughput indicators.

- **SSL/TLS Certificate Checker**  
  Inspects certificate validity, expiration dates, and TLS configuration issues.

- **DNS Propagation Checker**  
  Verifies how DNS records propagate across different resolvers worldwide.

## Why Browser-Based Network Tools Matter

Browser-based diagnostics provide several advantages:
- No installation or system permissions required
- Works across operating systems and devices
- Accessible from restricted or locked-down environments
- Easy to reproduce and share results

These tools are not meant to replace advanced command-line utilities, but to provide fast insights for common networking and connectivity issues.

## Typical Use Cases

- Verifying VPN behavior and DNS privacy
- Troubleshooting self-hosted services
- Debugging firewall and NAT configurations
- Checking certificate issues during renewals
- Understanding routing or latency problems
- Educational purposes and network learning

## Privacy and Data Handling

myIP.casa does not require user accounts or registrations.  
The tools are designed to minimize data collection and only process information necessary to perform the requested network checks.
